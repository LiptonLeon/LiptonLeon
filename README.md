## About me ##
Hi! My name is LiptonLeon. I'm studying at Technical University of Lodz and learning how to make cool games.
My engine of choice is Godot, but I've worked a bit in Unity and Unreal as well.

## Games I worked on: ##
- Graveyard of Time:  https://liptonleon.itch.io/graveyard-of-time
- Kapsle Racing:      https://liptonleon.itch.io/kapsle-racing
- Thin LED Line:      https://liptonleon.itch.io/thin-led-line
- Nycto:              https://liptonleon.itch.io/nycto
